# miam (Map Interactiv Adresses Manager)

MIAM is a adress manager providing a (google) map for visualisation. 

# History

My girlfriend and I were sharing a lot of restaurant adresses where we wanted to eat, but there were no way to store it and visualize it as I wanted. I tried Google MyMaps but it doesn't suit my need well since I wanted to categories it easily, add address, note them as visited as so on.

# Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


(web with Django, and mobile for android)
